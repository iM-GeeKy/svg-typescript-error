# How to start

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`. Notice typescript errors in `App.tsx` or run `npx typescript` to see error.
2. To start the application run `npx expo start`.

## To resolve the typescript error.

1. Install `react-native-svg` version `12.4.4` as [mentioned](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg/issues/1856#issuecomment-1238617363) by `react-native-svg` maintainers.
2. Notice the typescript error is gone in `App.tsx` or run `npx typescript`.
3. Verify the application still runs as expected using `npx expo start`.
